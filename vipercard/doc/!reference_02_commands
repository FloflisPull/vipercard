do {expression}
=====
        Take a string, and execute it as if it were a ViperCard script.

        Similar to eval() in other languages.

        Examples:

        put "answer " into buildScript
        put quote & "abc" & quote after buildScript
        do buildScript

sort [lines|items|chars] of {container}
sort [lines|items|chars] of {container} [descending|ascending]
sort [lines|items|chars] of {container} [numeric|text|international]
sort [lines|items|chars] of {container} by {expression}
=====
        New in ViperCard 0.3: 'sort by each' expressions.

        Sort styles:
        text sorting (default), compares text, not case sensitive.
        numeric sorting, interpret as numbers, e.g. 10 sorts after 2.
        international sorting, compares text using the current locale
                (because macosroman encoding is not unicode, international
                sorting likely won't give the expected results).

        Examples:

        put "aa,cc,bb" into x
        sort items of x
        answer x -- displays "aa,bb,cc"
        
        put "ac,bb,ca" into x
        sort items of x by char 2 of each
        answer x -- displays "ca,bb,ac"
