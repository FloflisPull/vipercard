## on afterKeyDown

Called when a key is pressed.
You can use the functions `keyChar()`,  `shiftKey()`,  `optionKey()`, 
and `commandKey()`, to determine which key(s) where pressed.

`keyRepeated()` can be used to see if the key event comes from
the key having been held down.


Examples:

```
on afterKeyDown
    if keyChar() is "i" and not shiftKey() and \
            optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed option-i"
    else if keyChar() is "U" and shiftKey() and \
            not optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed shift-u"
    end if
end afterKeyDown
```





## on afterKeyUp

Called when a key is pressed and released.
You can use the functions keyChar(), shiftKey(), optionKey(), and
commandKey(), to determine which key(s) where pressed.


Examples:

```
on afterKeyUp
    if keyChar() is "i" and not shiftKey() and \
            optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed option-i"
    else if keyChar() is "U" and shiftKey() and \
            not optionKey() and not commandKey() then
        answer "you pressed shift-u"
    end if
end afterKeyUp
```





## on closeBackground

When you go to a different card, if the card belongs to a different background, the closeBackground message will be sent. (You're leaving one background and going to another).


Examples:

```
-- in a background's script
on closeBackground
    answer "you have left this background"
end closeBackground
```





## on closeCard

Message sent upon leaving a card.

Because messages continue up the hierarchy until they are handled, you can also respond to closeCard in a stack script.


Examples:

```
-- in a card's script
on closeCard
    answer "you have left this card"
end closeCard
```





## on closeField

Sent when the user clicks on a field to select it, types text into the field, and then de-selects the field.

If the browse tool is active, this message will be sent by the following:
When typing text into a field, click outside the field
When typing text into a field, press Enter
When typing text into a field, go to a different card

See also: `openField` and `exitField`.

The message is sent to the target field and travels upward to the current card as usual.


Examples:

```
-- in a field's script

on closeField
    -- do a simple check of what the user just typed
    if not "@" in the target then
        put "not a e-mail address" into cd fld "status"
    else
        put "" into cd fld "status"
    end if
end closeField
```





## on exitField

Sent when the user clicks on a field to select it, does not type text into the field, and then de-selects the field.

If the browse tool is active, this message will be sent by the following:
When a field is selected, click outside the field
When a field is selected, press Enter
When a field is selected, go to a different card

It's possible for exitField to be sent to the field more than once if some of the above actions happen at the same time.

See also: `openField` and `closeField`.

The message is sent to the target field and travels upward to the current card as usual.


Examples:

```
-- in a field's script

on openField
    show cd btn "indicateCurrentlyEditingField"
end openField

on closeField
    hide cd btn "indicateCurrentlyEditingField"
end closeField

on exitField
    hide cd btn "indicateCurrentlyEditingField"
end exitField
```





## on idle

Sent repeatedly to the current card. Can be used for a game loop.

(Note that to terminate a script that is being called repeatedly, 
you can change to the button or field tool.)

To get faster idle calls, at the expense of heavier cpu usage,
use
`set the idlerate to "faster"`



## on mouseDoubleClick

Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse
tool (hand-shape). Create a button and type the example below.
Now when you choose the browse tool and double-click the
button, your code will run.


Examples:

```
on mouseDoubleClick
    answer "you double-clicked this button."
end mouseDoubleClick
```





## on mouseDown

Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the
Browse tool (hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse is 
pressed down onto the object. Create a button and type the 
example below. Now when you choose the browse tool and 
click the button, your code will run.


Examples:

```
on mouseDown
    answer "code is running."
end mouseDown
```





## on mouseEnter

Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse tool
(hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse enters the object.



## on mouseLeave

Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse tool
(hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse leaves the object.



## on mouseUp

Remember that scripts are only run when you're in the Browse tool
(hand-shape). Called whenever the mouse is clicked. To be precise,
when the mouse is pressed down onto the object, and released on
the same object. Create a button and type the example below. 
Now when you choose the browse tool and click the button, 
your code will run.


Examples:

```
on mouseUp
    answer "code is running."
end mouseUp
```





## on mouseWithin

Called repeatedly when the cursor is inside the object.
You can use the mouseloc() function to get the position of the 
cursor. This can be used to create drag/drop effects.

(Note that to terminate a script that is being called repeatedly, 
you can change to the button or field tool.)



## on openBackground

When you go to a different card, if the card belongs to a different background, the openBackground message will be sent. (You're leaving one background and going to another).


Examples:

```
-- in a background's script
on openBackground
    answer "welcome to this background"
end openBackground
```





## on openCard

Message sent upon going to a card.

Because messages continue up the hierarchy until they are handled, you can also respond to openCard in a stack script.


Examples:

```
-- in a card's script
on openCard
    answer "welcome to this card"
end openCard
```





## on openField

Sent to a field, when text is first selected in it.

See also: `closeField` and `exitField`.


Examples:

```
-- in a field's script

on openField
    -- place default text in the field when you tab over to it...
    put "abc" into the target
end openField
```





## on openStack

Message sent upon first opening the stack.


Examples:

```
-- in a stack's script
on openStack
    answer "welcome to this card"
end openStack
```
