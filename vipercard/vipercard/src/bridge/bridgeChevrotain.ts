// it seems like the best way to use the chevrotain typings,
// when potentially building as es6 modules,
// is to add a reference in the "types" section of tsconfig.json.
// doesn't need any modifications to the .d.ts
// so I don't need a bridge file here, code can reference
// `chevrotain.createToken` and it magically works.

// this library is bundled into externalmanualbundle.js and exists on globalThis

// in the past I had to have a custom chevrotain build because
// I made a change to avoid a call to new Function(); this has since been fixed.
